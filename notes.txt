Helpful SQL queries
-------------------

Get ranked solo races:

    SELECT races.id, races.name, races.format, users.username, races.datetime_finished FROM races JOIN race_participants ON races.id = race_participants.race_id JOIN users ON users.id = race_participants.user_id WHERE ranked = 1 AND solo = 1 ORDER BY datetime_finished LIMIT 10;

Get ranked solo races with a certain date range:

    SELECT races.id, races.name, races.format, users.username, races.datetime_finished FROM races JOIN race_participants ON races.id = race_participants.race_id JOIN users ON users.id = race_participants.user_id WHERE ranked = 1 AND solo = 1 AND races.datetime_finished > "2018-10-26 00:00:00" ORDER BY datetime_finished LIMIT 1;

Get the items (collectibles) for a race:

    SELECT * from race_participant_items WHERE race_participant_id = (SELECT id FROM race_participants WHERE user_id = (SELECT id FROM users WHERE users.username = "") AND race_id = 123) ORDER BY datetime_acquired;

Invalidate out of date ranked solo runs:

    UPDATE races SET ranked = 0 WHERE solo = 1 AND ranked = 1 AND datetime_finished > "2018-10-26 00:00:00";

Find races with finish times of under 1 minutes:

    SELECT races.id, races.datetime_finished, users.username, race_participants.run_time FROM races JOIN race_participants ON races.id = race_participants.race_id JOIN users ON users.id = race_participants.user_id WHERE race_participants.run_time < 60000 AND races.solo = 0 AND race_participants.place > 0 ORDER BY races.id;

    SELECT COUNT(races.id) FROM races JOIN race_participants ON races.id = race_participants.race_id JOIN users ON users.id = race_participants.user_id WHERE race_participants.run_time < 60000 AND races.solo = 0 AND race_participants.place > 0;

Fix tables not having "ON DELETE CASCADE":

    ALTER TABLE race_participants DROP FOREIGN KEY `race_participants_ibfk_2`;
    ALTER TABLE race_participants ADD CONSTRAINT `race_participants_ibfk_2` FOREIGN KEY (`race_id`) REFERENCES `races` (`id`) ON DELETE CASCADE;

Find all races from user:

    SELECT users.username, races.id, races.name, races.datetime_finished FROM races JOIN race_participants ON races.id = race_participants.race_id JOIN users ON users.id = race_participants.user_id WHERE users.username = "TestAccount1";

Delete corrupted races:

    DELETE FROM races WHERE ranked = 1 AND solo = 1 AND datetime_finished > "2021-12-03 00:00:00" AND datetime_finished < "2021-12-05 18:15:00";

Delete old ranked solo races for specific users:

    DELETE races FROM races JOIN race_participants ON race_participants.race_id = races.id JOIN users ON users.id = race_participants.user_id WHERE races.ranked = 1 AND races.solo = 1 AND races.datetime_finished > "2021-12-03 00:00:00" AND users.username = "mgln" AND races.id < 214073;

    DELETE races FROM races JOIN race_participants ON race_participants.race_id = races.id JOIN users ON users.id = race_participants.user_id WHERE races.ranked = 1 AND races.solo = 1 AND races.datetime_finished > "2021-12-03 00:00:00" AND users.username = "Gamonymous" AND races.id < 213906;

    DELETE races FROM races JOIN race_participants ON race_participants.race_id = races.id JOIN users ON users.id = race_participants.user_id WHERE races.ranked = 1 AND races.solo = 1 AND races.datetime_finished > "2021-12-03 00:00:00" AND users.username = "Monkeypot" AND races.id < 213818;

    DELETE races FROM races JOIN race_participants ON race_participants.race_id = races.id JOIN users ON users.id = race_participants.user_id WHERE races.ranked = 1 AND races.solo = 1 AND races.datetime_finished > "2021-12-03 00:00:00" AND users.username = "Fallenfor" AND races.id < 214038;
